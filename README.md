This **MERN Job Portal** is a personal project built to showcase my skills and expertise in web development. It is designed as a comprehensive platform where recruiters and job seekers can connect, post, and apply for jobs. The project demonstrates my proficiency in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and other modern web technologies.

## About the Project

This Job Portal is built with the aim to demonstrate my skills in full-stack development. The application serves as a platform for both job seekers and recruiters, allowing them to post, search, and manage job listings and applications. It features:

- **Role-based access** for job seekers and recruiters.
- A dynamic user interface using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN**.
- **Secure authentication** with JWT.
- **Real-time application tracking** for job seekers.

By building this project, I aimed to show my ability to:

- **Design and implement a full-stack application** using the MERN stack.
- **Build scalable and efficient RESTful APIs**.
- **Handle user authentication and authorization** securely.
- **Create a responsive and user-friendly frontend interface**.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js** for the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management.
- **Tailwind CSS & ShadCN** for responsive and clean UI.
- **Axios** for API calls.
- **React Router DOM** for page navigation.

### Backend

- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for building the server.
- **MongoDB** for data storage.
- **JWT** for authentication and authorization.
